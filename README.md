### Project Description:

The **Newsletter Popover** project is a functional and interactive webpage component designed to prompt users to subscribe to a newsletter. This component is triggered by a button click, causing a popover message to appear on the screen. The popover includes a message, an input field for the user's email address, and a sign-up button. This project is implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, showcasing the ability to create dynamic and user-friendly web elements.

### Key Features:

   - The button can be styled to blend seamlessly with the overall design of the webpage, encouraging user interaction.

2. **Popover Content:**
